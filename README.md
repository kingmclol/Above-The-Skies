Completed on 2023-06-20.

No further changes will be made. Probably.

## Description

Above the Skies is a 2D top-down shooter game made using Greenfoot.

You play as a plane pilot that fights off any threats.

The main goal is to simply survive as long as possible, and get the most kills you can.

That's about it.

## Pictures

I'll add some... *later*.
